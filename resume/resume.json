    "summary": "I’m a passionate developer with more than 5 years of experience in web and backend development both as freelancer and employee in small to medium companies. I have strong knowledge in JavaScript (SPA apps) and web frameworks like ReactJS, Redux, VueJS but I also in back-end programming like working with PHP frameworks and the .Net stack. I’m a big fan on using the latest technologies and tools for maximum productivity but I also believe that the best synergy is achieved when the team communicate and agrees on a workflow that fits the product and the company. I also like to provide fast and solid responsive web apps, that works cross browser and offer a good user experience. As for the future, I’m looking for opportunities where I can evolve even more in a motivating environment.",
